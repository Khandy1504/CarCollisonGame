# CarCollisonGame
 This is my first 3D modeled game in Unity game engine. There is no true goal intact but two players can crash into each other and other game objects to try and knock each other off. Player 1 controls through awsd and player 2 controls through the arrow keys. 

 This game taught me how to actually build something into the Unity game engine and get familiar with its basic systems. I learned the ins and outs of box colliders, rigid bodies, gravity, and how to implement a two player mode with differing keyboard functions. I also was familiarized with Unity libraries and functions in conjunction with C#.
